# Information about Google Summer of Code

MBDyn will partecipate to the **2021** edition of the [Google Summer of Code](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!
If you are interested in partecipating with us, here you can find information about:
  * [Project Ideas](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/blob/master/manual/gsoc/Project-Ideas.md)
  * [Our Entry Test](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/blob/master/manual/gsoc/Entry-Test.md)
  * [FAQs](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/blob/master/manual/gsoc/Frequently-Asked-Questions.md)

Please remember that participation in GSoC with MBDyn is not something you can improvise.  You must have adequate programming skills and knowledge of the project.  Please do not ask us to "help you understand how the project works".  If you can't pass the entry test, then likely you are not a good candidate, and there is very little we can do to help you (not to mention the fact that we have limited time, and - sad, but true - better ways to spend it).

Moreover, the spirit of GSoC is that you must have a sincere interest in joining the project's developers' community, you're able to show that you can give valuable contributions and, given the opportunity to receive occasional support by GSoC, you meet the requirements.  Please do not try to join the community if you don't have this sincere interest and all you're looking for is GSoC's grant.

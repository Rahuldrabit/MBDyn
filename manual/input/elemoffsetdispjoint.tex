\subsection{Offset displacement joint}
\label{sec:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:OFFSET_DISP_JOINT}
\emph{Author: Reinhard Resch}

This element is a rigid body coupling constraint similar to NASTRAN's \texttt{RBE2} element,
but it may be used also in the context of large deformations and large rotations.
It is needed mainly to provide an interface between solid or membrane elements, which are using \htmlref{\kw{structural displacement node}}{sec:NODE:STRUCTURAL}s with only three degrees of freedom,
and the large family of elements (e.g. joints, forces, ...) which can be used only for \htmlref{\kw{structural node}}{sec:NODE:STRUCTURAL}s with six degrees of freedom.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{joint_type} ::= \kw{offset displacement joint}

    \bnt{joint_arglist} ::=
       (\ty{StructNode}) \bnt{node_label_1} ,
       (\ty{StructDispNode}) \bnt{node_label_2}
       [ , \kw{position} , \bnt{position_node_2} ]
\end{Verbatim}

The position of the \nt{node\_label\_2} is constrained in a way, that it's following exactly the rigid body motion of \nt{node\_label\_1}.
So, a rigid connection is created.

\subsubsection{Output}
The output occurs in the \texttt{.jnt} file, which contains the reaction force and reaction couple related to the \nt{node\_label\_1}.

\subsubsection{Private Data}
The following data is available:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \kw{"Fx"} reaction force at \nt{node\_label\_1} along \nt{node\_label\_1} axis 1
\item \kw{"Fy"} reaction force at \nt{node\_label\_1} along \nt{node\_label\_1} axis 2
\item \kw{"Fz"} reaction force at \nt{node\_label\_1} along \nt{node\_label\_1} axis 3

\item \kw{"Mx"} reaction moment at \nt{node\_label\_1} along \nt{node\_label\_1} axis 1
\item \kw{"My"} reaction moment at \nt{node\_label\_1} along \nt{node\_label\_1} axis 2
\item \kw{"Mz"} reaction moment at \nt{node\_label\_1} along \nt{node\_label\_1} axis 3

\item \kw{"fx"} reaction force at \nt{node\_label\_1} along global axis 1
\item \kw{"fy"} reaction force at \nt{node\_label\_1} along global axis 2
\item \kw{"fz"} reaction force at \nt{node\_label\_1} along global axis 3

\item \kw{"mx"} reaction moment at \nt{node\_label\_1} along global axis 1
\item \kw{"my"} reaction moment at \nt{node\_label\_1} along global axis 2
\item \kw{"mz"} reaction moment at \nt{node\_label\_1} along global axis 3
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Example.}
This example mimics an instance of NASTRAN's \texttt{RBE2} element.

## üß¨ GA Configuration Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `popSize`       | Size of the population (number of individuals per generation)              |
| `numGen`        | Number of generations per optimization call (often set to 1 in real-time)  |
| `crossRate`     | Crossover probability (typically between 0.6‚Äì0.9)                           |
| `mutRate`       | Mutation probability per gene (e.g., 0.01‚Äì0.2)                              |
| `elitism`       | Number of best individuals preserved each generation                        |
| `history`       | Number of past generations to keep track of (optional, for analysis/logs)   |
| `seed`          | Seed for the random number generator (ensures reproducibility)              |

## üîÅ GA Operators

| Operator            | Options        | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `crossover type`     | `uniform`, `arithmetic`, `single-point`, `two-point` | Defines how parent individuals combine their genes                         |
| `mutation type`      | `gaussian`, `uniform`, `creep`                      | Determines how random variation is introduced                              |
| `selection type`     | `tournament`, `roulette`, `rank`                   | Determines how individuals are selected for reproduction                    |

## üîå Inputs and Outputs

- `inputs number`: Specifies how many actuator or muscle elements are controlled.
  - Each `element, <ID>, joint, string, "M[2]", direct` line maps to one element and its control mode.
  - `"M[2]"` might refer to a moment or torque DOF.

- `output number`: IDs of `drive caller` outputs to observe GA result (e.g., activation, torque, etc.)

---

## üõ† Notes

- You must implement the corresponding `GeneticAlgorithmOptimization` logic in C++.
- This block should:
  - Read element states
  - Evaluate fitness using `libgafitness.so` or inline logic
  - Apply optimized activation to the connected elements
- `.so` files (e.g. `libgafitness.so`) can be dynamically linked to compute fitness or constraints externally.

## ‚úÖ Running the Simulation

1. Build your user-defined element plugin.
2. Run MBDyn with this input file:
   ```bash
   mbdyn -f test_ga_superelement.mbd
   ```
3. Analyze results in `output.res` or via the configured output channels.

MBDyn implementation of Andrew's squeezer mechanism, initially proposed
in W. Schiehlen (ed.) Multibody Systems Handbook, Springer-Verlag, 1990.

Part of the IFToMM multibody benchmarking effort:
<http://www.iftomm-multibody.org/benchmark/problem/Andrews'_squeezer_mechanism/>

List of files:
	andrewssqueezer
	andrewssqueezer_int
	andrewssqueezer_assembler
		andrewssqueezer_assembler.set
		andrewssqueezer.ref
		andrewssqueezer.set
	andrewssqueezer.sh
	andrewssqueezer.plt

* Files andrewssqueezer.set and andrewssqueezer.ref contain the definitions
of common data and reference systems

* File andrewssqueezer_assembler assembles the mechanism in its initial
configuration: execute

	mbdyn -f andrewssqueezer_assembler -o tmpfile

and extract the final positions of points E, F, G, H

* File andrewssqueezer_assembler.set contains the definitions of the final
positions of points E, F, G, H at the end of the assembly procedure

* File andrewssqueezer performs the main analysis: execute

	mbdyn -f andrewssqueezer -o x6

* Ancillary file andrewssqueezer.sh extracts the trajectory of point F

* Ancillary file andrewssqueezer.plt plots the trajectory of point F:
execute

	gnuplot andrewssqueezer.plt

* File andrewssqueezer_int is an alternative main file, containing the means
for the comparison of several different integration schemes.

{rm}flag.dat (can) contain values:

0	// EDGE is initializing; MBDyn waits
1	// EDGE is busy; MBDyn waits
2	// EDGE waits (is ready to read kinematics); MBDyn iterates
3	// EDGE is computing; MBDyn waits before reading forces
4	// EDGE converged; MBDyn advances one step
5	// EDGE wants to end simulation

{rm}data.dat contain data in both ways

utils/test_modalext_edge.c contains a simple process that exchanges data
with MBDyn according to the EDGE specification for a model based
on the modal joint.  Execute

	mbdyn -f edge

and
	test_modalext_edge -c 2 -s 1 \
		-M 4 -m flag=mflag.dat -m data=mdata.dat \
		-r flag=rflag.dat -r data=rdata.dat

to test.  Omit either the last line or the previous one to test with only
modal or rigid data, respectively.

Test for socket-based external modal forces.  Usage:

- run MBDyn:
$ mbdyn socket

- run the test peer:
$ utils/test_modalext_socket -H local:///tmp/mbdyn.sock -r -M 4 -c 3 -s 0 -v


Alternatively, if python support is available:

- run the python script which plays the role of the peer solver,
  and takes care of executing MBDyn:
$ python socket.py


Test for socket-based external modal mapping forces.  Usage:

- run MBDyn:
$ mbdyn modalmappingsocket

- run the test peer:
$ utils/test_modalext_socket -H local:///tmp/mbdyn.sock -r -M 3 -c 1 -s 0 -v -x

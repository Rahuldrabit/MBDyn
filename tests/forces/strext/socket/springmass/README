Files:

mbdyn.sh		shell script that invokes MBDyn with right paths
springmass		MBDyn input file
springmass.py		python script for peer process
springmass.m		Matlab script for peer process



General:

	- make sure the right paths are set in mbdyn.sh



To execute the python script:

	- MBDyn must be compiled with --enable-python

	- make sure the right paths are set in springmass.py

	- execute:

		$ python springmass.py

	- the output will be stored in output.*



To execute the matlab script:

	- MBDyn must be compiled with --enable-python

	- pymex
	  <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27255-pymex>
	  must be compiled and installed in Matlab's path

	- make sure the right paths are set in springmass.m

	- from Matlab's command windon execute

		$ springmass

	- the output will be stored in output.*

INTRODUCTION

This is a test for the modal joint.

OUTLINE

The procedure is:

1) Generate the FEM model

	a) prepare the FEM bulk data deck
	b) add the ALTER file
	c) run the FEM analysis
	d) generate the modal element data

2) Prepare and run the multibody model

	a) define the modal node
	b) define the interface nodes
	c) define the modal element

Examples:

beam.mbd		- a cantilevered beam is loaded at the free end.

beam_clamped.mbd	- same as beam.mbd, but instead of using 
			  the modal node, the modal element is directly
			  clamped, thus saving 18 dofs.

beam_2.mbd		- a cantilevered beam supports another beam hinged
			  by a revolute joint in a L-shaped mechanism; both 
			  beams are represented by the very same modal data,
			  and appropriate re-orientations and offsets are 
			  considered to illustrate their use.

beam_2_clamped.mbd	- same as beam_2.mbd, but instead of using 
			  the modal node, the first modal element 
			  is directly clamped, thus saving 18 dofs.

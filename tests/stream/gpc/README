GPC REGULATOR TEST

files description:

- system3M_set_s2s

	This file contains the MBDyn model of a 3 masses- 3 springs - 3 dampers mechanical system.
	The baseline value of masses, stiffness and damping are set in file "system3M.set".
	The system is controlled using 3 forces applied to the masses and the displacement of the
	3 masses is measured. 
	After 50 seconds the system becomes unstable as a consequence of a imposed negative value of the 
	damping value of the third damper. 

- sockets/controls.sock & sockets/measures.sock
	
	These files contains the collected measured sent to the GPC regulator and the control variables
	computed by the GPC regulator.

- IDinput.txt
	
	This file contains the "identification input" used to identify the system. A 10 Hz low-pass
	filtered random input is used.

- NOISE.txT

	This file contains the measurement noise.

- GPCdata.txt

	This file contains the data for the GPC regulator (it is the input files for the executable "s2s_gpc" 
	available in ../../../utils). 
	The identifier is turned on after 10 s and thereafter kept always active. 
	The controller is turned on after 30 s. Then it is turned off between 70 s and 75 s (when the system
	is unstable). 
	The example shows how the GPC regulator can reduce the vibrations of the system, it is able to
	follow the system variations, keeping the system stable. Moreover it is able to recover stabilty 
	when the controller is turned off for a short interval and the system response diverges.

usage:

- execute the MBDyn model (from this folder)

	mbdyn -f system3M_set_s2s 

- exacute the GPC regulator (from this folder)

	../../../utils/s2s_gpc GPCdata.txt

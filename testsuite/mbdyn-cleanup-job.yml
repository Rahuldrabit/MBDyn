mbdyn-cleanup-job:
  variables:
    ## Send a kill -9 to all running octave and mbdyn processes owned by the same user and without a terminal connected.
    ## For a better solution see also https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27443#note_1197449654
    ## "no"       Do not start the pipeline if there are any running processes! This option should be safe.
    ## "yes"      Kill all running processes!
    ##            This must not be the default option, and it should be used only as a last resort solution!
    ##            In such a situation just go to "https://public.gitlab.polimi.it/DAER/mbdyn/-/pipelines/new"
    ##            and override the default value by "yes"!
    ## "disabled" Ignore running processes. Probably not a safe option.
